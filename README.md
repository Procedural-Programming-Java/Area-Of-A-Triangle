# Area-Of-A-Triangle

In this program our objective, is to write a Java program that will compute the area of a triangle, by using Herons Formula. We
are given 5 different sets of data, representing lengths of two sides of a triangle that we are calling lengthA and lengthB (variables). 
Therefore, we need to use the Pythagorean- Theorem to get the length of lengthC, in order to enable us to use the Herons- Formula. Once we having all the variables, we will need to conduct a two-step process. The first step is by finding half perimeter (S) before finding the area. The Formula is s = (a + b + c)/2. The
Second step is to find the area of the triangle by using this formula Area=sqrt(s(s-a)(s-b)(s-c)). We will need to add 5 more additional data than what
was given to us in order to complete this program.
